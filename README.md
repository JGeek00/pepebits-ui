# Pepebits frontend
Created with React.js and SASS.

## Develop
Clone this repo and execute `npm install` to install all required Node.js libraries.

### Start dev server
Runing `npm run dev` will start the dev server on localhost:3000.

### Run SASS compiler
Inside /src folder run `sass --watch ./scss/style.scss:./css/style.css`. This will read and compile all style.scss content and throw the result into style.css.
